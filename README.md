PokemonGO Map
=============

PokemongGO Map to discover the location of nearby pokemons.

This project worked along with a python-based API parser that get the pokemon locations and add id to this project database.

I made this code in a hackaton style event, so I didn't work with all the Symfony phylosophy, just quick :)

### Features

- **Map based**: work with Google Maps API (with leaflet library)
- **Current location search**: search pokemon nearby or within another location
- **Heatmap**: not exactly location, heatmap calculation and generation represented on the map
- **Filter results**: you can filter the results by pokemon type, name, ,etc..


### Install

You can install this game like any other Symfony2 project
